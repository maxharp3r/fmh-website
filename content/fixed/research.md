As a researcher, I build and study personalization technology in online systems.
I think it is important and interesting to study humans, algorithms, and interfaces together.
I specialize in quantitative, empirical methods, but I like employing multiple
methods, and I enjoy branching out.

If you are interested in learning about my research, try reading something I've written.
Here are a couple of my favorite research papers:

* [Putting Users in Control of Their Recommendations](http://files.grouplens.org/papers/harper-recsys2015.pdf) (Recsys 2015)
* [Facts or Friends? Distinguishing Informational and Conversational Questions in Social Q\&A Sites](http://files.grouplens.org/papers/harper-chi2009.pdf) (CHI 2009)

I have dedicated much of my time over the past several years to the care and
feeding of [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), an online movie recommendation web site.
MovieLens is unique because it is both a genuinely useful tool for finding movies to watch
and a research platform that hosts a variety of social computing experiments.


## prospective students

I like working with self-motivated master's students and undergraduates.
I can help students gain experience in social computing research or software engineering.

I am always looking for students to work on MovieLens, which is a nice starting point for either
a research or a software development direction.
Students who succeed must have the ability to self-teach and a willingness to learn.

If you wish to work with me, [contact me](/connect/) to set up a meeting.
I am happy to meet with anyone; in most cases, I will tell you about a few possible
projects, and set you up with a "homework" assignment to test your commitment and ability.
