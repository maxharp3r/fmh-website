As a researcher, I build and study personalization technology in online systems.
I think it is important and interesting to study humans, algorithms, and interfaces together.
I specialize in quantitative, empirical methods, but I think the best work involves multiple
methods, and I enjoy branching out.

I have dedicated much of my time over the past several years to the care and
feeding of [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), an online movie recommendation web site.
MovieLens is cool and unique because it is a genuinely useful tool for finding movies to watch,
while also serving as a research platform that hosts a variety of experiments on social computing.


## prospective students

I like working with self-motivated master's students and undergraduates.
I can help students gain experience in social computing research or software engineering.

I am usually looking for students to work on MovieLens, which is a nice starting point for either
a research or a software development direction.
Students who succeed will have the ability to self-teach, and a willingness to learn.

If you wish to work with me, contact me to set up a meeting.
I am happy to meet with anyone; in most cases, I will tell you about a few possible
projects, and set you up with a "homework" assignment to test your committment and ability.
